A worker earns $10 an hour for the first 8 hours.
For every overtime hour, he earns $15.

On weekends, the employer pays double the usua Irate, regardless how many hours were worked pr eviously that week. For instance, 10 hours worked
on a weekday would pay 80+30 = $110, but on a
weekend it would pay 160+60 = $220.

Examples:

```js
'weeklySalary ([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]) // - 400
weeklysalary ([10, 10, 10, 0, 8, 0, 0]) // - 410
weeklysalary([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0]) // - 280

```

Write an algorithm to help the worker figure out his pay.

Every element in the array is greater than or equal to o
